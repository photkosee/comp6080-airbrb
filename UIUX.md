### Alignment
- All cards (listing) are aligned properly

### Fonts/Visibility/Consistency
- Using only 1 font family to limit the number of different text styling (for consistency)
- Ensure the way the fonts are displayed throughout the project (h for title, body for the rest and bigger for what more important but consistency). This also helps us to easily point out what important to the users

### Colors/Consistency/Minimalism
- Using a good set of colors (our main theme is white and blue which are harmonious colors), and testing with the color tools to make sure our colors are going well

### Affordances/Visibility/Common Standards & Conventions
- An explicit affordance for all of the button components to tell users how to interact
- A pattern affordance with common icons to imply the interaction is possible for most of the interactable components
- Having no false affordance

### Feedback
- Having a toast messages for all of the interaction that requires feedback to help users know that their actions have been taken

### Constraints
- Limiting the errors users can make by disable the submit button for most of the features that is appropricate
- Only allow users to delete pending bookings

### Effectiveness & Utility
- Having navbar on all pages, making it easier for the users to navigate
- Allowing users to edit, delete as appropriate

### Efficency
- Not having multi steps forms

### Safety
- Having a confirmation modal for actions such as delete (booking and listing), publish

### Learnability
- Having proper label and title to make it easier for the users to understand

### Designing for Emotions
- Having circular progress indicating when something is not done loading
